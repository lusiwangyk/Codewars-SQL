Remove First and Last Character

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

Solution:
-- # write your SQL statement here: you are given a table 'removechar' with column 's', return a table with column 's' and your result in a column named 'res'.
SELECT s, SUBSTRING(s,2,LENGTH(s)-2) as res
FROM removechar



Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

Solution: 
SELECT x, REPLACE(x,' ', '') as res
FROM nospace
